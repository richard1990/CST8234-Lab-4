# CST8234 Lab #4 - Simple Linked List
This was my fourth lab assignment I created in my "C Language and Network Programming" course at Algonquin College. Written in C using Vim, the program functions as a basic linked list, with the nodes containing an integer value and a pointer to the next node. Insertions and deletions are done at the head. The user can add a new node with an integer value, delete the head node, delete all nodes, display the length of the linked list, and print all the integer values of the linked list.

This program introduced me to the concept of pointers and general C programming. Note the program was written using Vim on Linux and compiled with GCC using the "ansi", "pedantic", and "Wall" flags.
